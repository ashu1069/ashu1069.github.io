Hi! I am Ashutosh Kumar, a master's student of Artificial Intelligence at Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA.

My primary interests are Computer Vision, Deep learning, and Operations Research. For the past few months, I have been working on a bio-inspired algorithm for object detection in low-visibility conditions, tried my hands on Generative AI, and diving into the fascinating world of Large Language Models and published my work on Heirarchical Prompting Taxonomy. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Neurosymbolic AI and AI for healthcare in which I have done my bachelor thesis on the topic of Anomaly Detection in Digital Chest X-Rays.

This summer, I worked on a data fusion algorithm for a global vaccine prioritization model at Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 

Outside academia, I am a huge fan of cricket. I love to read books, write poetry and play cricket and badminton.
